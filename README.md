# CS195-Fall24-Notebook-2
## Simple Neural Networks: MLP and CNN!

<b>Due</b>: Monday, September 23th, 2024

## How this is going to work: 

I've provided some starter code for you. Before you go any further, click on the `notebook2_mlp_starter.ipynb` and `notebook2_cnn_starter.ipynb` links in the repository, and then, at the top of the notebook, you will see a button that says `Open in Colab`. Click on this and it will open the starter code in Google Colaboratory.
 
# **Task#1**: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
For this task, you'll be building a four-layer MLP following the specifications provided in `notebook2_mlp_starter.ipynb`. When answering the questions, please include both the PyTorch code and your written explanations. The final question asks you to create a diagram of your network, so be sure to show all the details, including the edges and how everything is connected.



# **Task#2**: Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
For this task, you'll be building a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) following the specifications provided in `notebook2_cnn_starter.ipynb`. When answering the questions, please include both the PyTorch code and your written explanations. The final question asks you to create a diagram of your network, so be sure to show all the details, including the filters and how they are operating on the tensors.


Use the two starter notebooks to finish the implementations. Submit this assignment through the CodePost link (find it on Blackboard).

## :white_check_mark: Grading: 
I will update the following rubric with your grade after you have completed the assignment.
